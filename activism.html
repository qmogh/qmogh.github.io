        I organized my first protest when I was a freshman in high school. After
        two short months of organizing with my two closest friends, 300 students
        walked out together to protest gun violene, while rasing money to donate
        to victims of it, ending with a mass call session of our legislators.
        Even though now I feel differently about gun legislation than I did at
        the time, I'm still grateful for this experience as a start to my
        organizing.

        One year later, I helped organize two climate strikes in Indiana, and
        also got involved with the
        <a href="https://hsdems.org">High School Democrats of America.</a> I
        helped expand chapter into new states, set up voter registration drives
        across the country, as well as build our tech infrastructure.
      </p>

        Now, I'm working with the Connecticut Youth Climate Strike as well as
        the national organization, helping furthering our policy and platform
        with leftist, anti-capitalist, and revolutionary policies. I also help
        develope our existing and new chapters. Currently, we have shifted focus
        in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement alongside the local
        protests going on across the country.
