        I got introduced to Hackathons by my good friend <a href="https://matthewstanciu.me/">Matthew</a>, who invited me to his event, Codeday Indy. Two months later, I helped him organize it, and it became one of the first ever hackathon events in Indiana.

        That summer, I organized <a href="https://2019.windyhacks.com/">Windy City Hacks</a>, 24 hour hackathon for students all over Chicago. While helping raise over $14,000 while planning the logistics of the event, I had an absolute blast organizing this with some of my closest friends. Over 320 students registered, over half of whom showed up for a fantastic event full of mentors, workshops, prizes, and games.

      <p>
        Windy Hacks got cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic, but we have many incredible ideas to change the way High School Hackathons work, and I can't wait.
