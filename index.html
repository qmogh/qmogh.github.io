    <p><strong>Hi! I'm Amogh Chaubey</strong> (he/him), a 19 year old student organizer & programmer based in Storrs, Connecticut. I'm passionate about community building, transparency, inclusiveness, & radical politics. Currently, I'm reading The Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse.</p>
    <p>I woke up in a wonderful new world during high school - I learned how to code. Now I'm exploring this new world of creativity and trying to build everyday. In the past, I worked to make Hack Club's community the best place on the internet. I ran <a class="green" href="https://arts-gala.hackclub.dev/">community events</a>, <a class="green" href="https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk">AMA's</a>, worked on their <a class="green" href="https://hackclub.com/bank/">fiscal sponsorship platform</a>, and more.</p>
    <p>I also helped organize <a class="green" href="https://windyhacks.com/">Windy City Hacks</a>, one of Chicago's biggest high school hackathons. I helped fundraise $15,000, coordinated logistics for the event, and helped lead day-of workshops and activities. Over 300 students registered for the event, several of which were brand new to coding.</p>
    <p>In the past, I've worked on technical & non technical roles with <a class="green" href="http://votecampbell.org/">campaigns</a> and <a class="blue" href="strikewithus.org">climate justice groups</a>. Currently, I'm an assistant director for <a href="https://imuna.org/" class="blue">IMUNA</a>, a non-profit, UN Department of Global Education affiliated organization dedicated to education through simulation.</p>
