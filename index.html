        <strong>Hi! I'm Amogh Chaubey</strong> (he/him), a 21 year old student organizer & programmer based in Storrs, Connecticut. I woke up in a wonderful new world during high school - I learned how to code.</p> 
        <!-- <p>In the past, I've worked in technical & non-technical roles for campaigns and climate justice groups. Now I'm helping create engaging and transformative learning opportunities to empower students. </p> -->
         <p>I've had the fortune of working for some awesome places in both <a style="color: green" href="https://www.fidelity.com/">technical</a> & <a style="color: orange" href="https://imuna.org/nhsmun/nyc/"> non-technical roles</a>. Currently, I'm doing <a style="color: blue" href="https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/">computational phylogenetic research</a> at UConn, using algorithms and software to help understand evolutionary ancestry of our individual genes.</p> 
         <p>I'm also an intern at the UConn Office of Sustainability -- I collect, analyze, and help understand our carbon and <a style="color: green" href="https://sustainability.uconn.edu/operations/greenhouse-gas-ghg-inventories/">greenhouse gas data</a>, all while <a style="color: orange" href="https://dailycampus.com/2024/10/17/annual-haunted-heep-trail-walk-returns-to-uconn/">organzing events</a> along the way.</p> 
    <p>In high school, I worked to make <a  href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>'s community the best place on the internet. I ran <a href="https://arts-gala.hackclub.dev/">community events</a> for hackers all over the globe, hosted and produced <a href="https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk">AMA's</a> for some of the biggest names in technology, and worked for their <a href="https://hackclub.com/bank/">fiscal sponsorship platform</a> which hosts over 500+ organizations with over $5 million in transactions. I also helped organize <a class="blue" href="https://windyhacks.com/">Windy City Hacks</a>, one of Chicago's biggest high school hackathons. I helped fundraise $15,000, coordinated logistics for the event, and helped lead day-of workshops and activities. </p>
