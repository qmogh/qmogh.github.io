        <strong>Hi! I'm Amogh Chaubey</strong> (he/him), a 22 year old  organizer & programmer. I woke up in a wonderful new world during high school - I learned how to code.</p> 
        <!-- <p>In the past, I've worked in technical & non-technical roles for campaigns and climate justice groups. Now I'm helping create engaging and transformative learning opportunities to empower students. </p> -->
        <p>Right now, I'm a software engineer at <a style="color: green" href="https://cosmoslabs.io">Cosmos Labs</a>, helping build a freer, decentralized internet. I'm working on blockchain infrastructure that empowers developers and communities to create better tools for the internet's future.</p>

        <p>In college, I was a student researcher at UConn’s <a style="color: blue" href="https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/">Computational Biology Lab</a>, where I worked on algorithms to understand the evolutionary ancestry of our genes. I also interned at the <a style="color: green" href="https://sustainability.uconn.edu/">UConn Office of Sustainability</a> — analyzing carbon and <a style="color: green" href="https://sustainability.uconn.edu/operations/greenhouse-gas-ghg-inventories/">greenhouse gas data</a>, and <a style="color: orange" href="https://dailycampus.com/2024/10/17/annual-haunted-heep-trail-walk-returns-to-uconn/">organizing events</a> to drive climate action on campus.</p>
        
        <p>In high school, I helped grow the <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> community into one of the most creative, welcoming tech spaces for students. I ran <a href="https://events.hackclub.com/past/">events</a> for hackers around the world, hosted <a href="https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk">AMAs</a> with major tech leaders, and worked on Hack Club’s <a href="https://hackclub.com/bank/">fiscal sponsorship platform</a> — which now powers 500+ organizations and has processed over $5 million in transactions. I also co-organized <a class="blue" href="https://2019.windyhacks.com/">Windy City Hacks</a>, one of Chicago’s largest high school hackathons, where I led fundraising, logistics, and workshops.</p>
        
        <p>I'd boil down my desires to produce real work that impacts real people. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:chaubeyamogh@gmail.com">chaubeyamogh@gmail.com</a>!</p>
        
    <!-- <p>I'm a director for <a  class="blue2" href="https://imuna.org/" class="green">IMUNA</a>, a non-profit affiliated with the UN Department of Global Education dedicated to education through simulation. I research and write on global issues, create educational & accessible content for students all over the globe, and help organize the biggest Model U.N. conference in the world.</p>
