        <strong>Hi! I'm Amogh Chaubey</strong> (he/him), a 19 year old student organizer & programmer based in Storrs, Connecticut. 
        I'm passionate about community building, education, & radical politics. I woke up in a wonderful new world during high school - I learned how to code.</p> 
        <p>In the past, I've worked in technical & non-technical roles for campaigns and climate justice groups. Now I'm helping create engaging and transformative learning opportunities to empower students. </p>
    <p>Previously, I worked to make <a  href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>'s community the best place on the internet. I ran <a href="https://arts-gala.hackclub.dev/">community events</a> for hackers all over the globe, hosted and produced <a href="https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk">AMA's</a> for some of the biggest names in technology, and worked for their <a href="https://hackclub.com/bank/">fiscal sponsorship platform</a> which hosts over 500+ organizations with over $5 million in transactions.</p>
    <p>I also helped organize <a class="blue" href="https://windyhacks.com/">Windy City Hacks</a>, one of Chicago's biggest high school hackathons. I helped fundraise $15,000, coordinated logistics for the event, and helped lead day-of workshops and activities. Over 300 students registered for the event, several of which were brand new to coding.</p>
    <p>I'm an assistant director for <a  class="blue2" href="https://imuna.org/" class="green">IMUNA</a>, a non-profit, UN Department of Global Education affiliated organization dedicated to education through simulation. I research and write on global issues, create educational & accessible content for students all over the globe, and help organize the biggest Model U.N. conference in the world.</p>
