        I've worked on multiple campaigns at the local, state, and federal
        level. Some of my favorite ones were Chris Campbell's Indiana Senate
        campaign, and Solomon Rajput's 2020 Congressional Campaign. There I met
        some incredible people, had a lot of fun, and spent hours phonebanking,
        canvassing, and more. Overall, I've worked on five different campaigns.

        However, it's hard to say that I still believe in the system after all
        of this. After watching the DNC actively work against Bernie Sanders in
        two different presidental runs, seeing the
        <a href="https://polytrope.com/district/">gerrymandering</a> happening
        all over the country, seeing meaningful third party, grassroots, and
        unique candidates being shut down - I don't think real change comes from
        most political elections. At most, I think if you want change in your
        community, that change comes from local elections. I'm unsure if the
        working class is ever beneffitted from federal elections, or if it
        changes anything.
